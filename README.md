# FINESSE US - Combating Fashion Waste 

## Overview and Origin
Finesse US is a clothing company that is leveraging AI to implement their ethos. The company
aims to reduce excess inventory and fashion waste by only creating what's in demand. The founder of Finesse USA,Rahmin Ahmari, used his knowledge of trend models to create a
fashion company which only supplies what’s “in”. Ahmari was able to generate $4.5 Million in Seed-Funding and now has a company valued at approx. $1 Million. The clothing  
brand’s demographic is mainly women and the LGBTQIA+ community. The company aims to provide an inclusive brand that caters to all beauties irregardless of size. 

## Business Activities
 Finesse US has used AI in three main ways: Trend Forecasting Garment Creation, and Marketing. Finesse US uses various Machine Learning Models to predict what trends are in demand. Forbes did an article with Ahmari and he explained how the compAny uses AI in their workflow:
> Whilst data analysis for trends is not new, FINESSE is operating using deep tech in an unparalleled way, combining time series analysis, natural
> language processing, and computer vision within its machine learning algorithms, indicating the fashion trends Gen Z most want at any given moment.

AI has allowed the company to identify new trends but also increase their lead time:
>Finesse then uses this data to design new products. Ahmari said that by taking advantage of a
>“very fast supply chain,” along with tools like CLO 3D-modeling software, Finesse can go from
>identifying a trend to having a product available for purchase in less than 25 days.

   This innovative clothing brand then generates three renderings of clothing that is then voted
on by its clientele. Whatever piece wins the popular vote is then moved on to production. In
addition to using AI for trend forecasting and increasing supply chain lead time, the majority
of their instagram consists of AI generated images ofheir products.

## Landscape

Finesse US is not the only fashion company leveraging AI. Below is a list of other big labels and how they use AI: 

###### VEO - Online Sustainable Marketplace:                                                                                            
Veo simulates the Manafacturing process so people can decide on color dyes, fabrics, and other accesories without actually using them. This eliminates waste and the use of materials that may not even see its way through the manafacturing cycle. Designers can boost creativity and "create" different variations of garments which then allows them to make informed design decisions.                     

##### ZARA - Unisex Clothing Brand                                                               
Zara uses robots to fetch customer orders. This allows for sales associates time to help foot traffic with clothing reccomendations, and any other customer support tasks. Zara also uses micro-chip technology developed by ML & AI Models. This chip allows users to know where in the supply chain a paticular size or style lies.                                                                                 

##### H&M - Unisex Clothing Brand                                                                                                                               
H&M uses AI models to understand whats trending and to assess purchase quantity, purchase timing, and the location of the product within the store. H&M, simillar to Finesse USA, uses data collected from AI to make informed production descisions. This reduces overall fashion waste.

## Results & Reccomendations
While Finesse US has been able to leverage AI in their creative process, the company can now invest in ways that can help improve the overall consumer buying process. Finesse should implement ways to enable virtual try ons. Users can get an idea of what the product would look like on them with realistic virtual imagery. Another way Finesse can elevate the buying process is by eliminating the guessing game around sizing. Similar to Sephora's shade finder which allows users to enter one product shade to calculate what their shade would be in another product, Finesse can allow users to enter their sizes for other brands and it would spit out what their size would be in the Finesse product. A lot of issues for consumers is price discrepancy in the omni channel market. By simplifying this and eliminating the confusion around size and fit, Finesse can increase their buyer confidence.
